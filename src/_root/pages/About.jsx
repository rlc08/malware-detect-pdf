                    The Portable Document Format (PDF) has become a widely used
                    standard for document exchange due to its portability and
                    flexibility. However, these same qualities have made it a
                    prime target for cybercriminals, who exploit vulnerabilities
                    in the PDF format to distribute malicious code.This project
                    focuses on developing a machine learning-based detection
                    system that leverages feature extraction techniques, such as
                    analyzing embedded JavaScript, file structure, and metadata,
                    to distinguish between benign and malicious PDFs. This
                    research aims to improve threat detection platforms by
                    providing an adaptable solution for combating PDF-borne
                    attacks through data-driven insights and advanced machine
                    learning methodologies.
